## 1. Set Up the Development Environment

- [x] Install Python: Download and install the latest version of Python from the official website.
- [x] Install Flask: Open your terminal and run `pip install Flask`.
- [x] Install SQLAlchemy: Run `pip install SQLAlchemy`.
- [x] Install Requests: Run `pip install requests`.

## 2. Design the Project Architecture

- [ ] Outline the components of the application.
- [ ] Define the routes and URL patterns.
- [ ] Plan the views and templates.
- [ ] Design the database schema and models.

## 3. Create the Flask Application

- [x] Set up a new Python file (e.g., `app.py`) to create the Flask application instance.
- [x] Configure the application by setting the `SECRET_KEY` and enabling `DEBUG` mode.

## 4. Set Up the Database

## 15. Test the Application

- [ ] Write unit tests for the application's functionality.
- [ ] Test the application on different browsers and devices.

## 16. Deploy the Application
